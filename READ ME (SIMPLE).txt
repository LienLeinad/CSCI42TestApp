How to run:
1. Connect to a PRIVATELY OWNED network. This will not work for public networks
2. Double-click run.bat
3. You'll see a bunch of text show up in a command prompt, look for 
"Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:"
and under it, you'll see something like
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : <some IP address>
4. Using that ip address, go to the phone that you'll use to track life on stage. Type in the browser's URL bar
"<The IP address>:8000/home"
This will bring the user to the page where they can update the names and life totals of the players
5. In the Streaming Computer, open a web browser and type "localhost:8000/home" in the address
This will bring the user to the page where they can update the names and life totals of the players, as well as
display the data to the stream.
6. Inputs should all be done by the user with the phone, to avoid any bugs.
7. If any bugs occur during use, simply refresh the browser page on either devices.
